      <description>Want to get more out of that next article you read that describes how to solve a problem? My advisor in graduate school gave me a great tip on how to do it.
Start reading the article normally, but stop right before the author describes how they solved the problem. You should have an idea about the problem and some of the important issues involved. Set the paper aside and spend about 10 minutes creating your own solution to the problem.</description>
